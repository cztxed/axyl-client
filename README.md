My Old project from 20/04/2024 *(That's when I started, there were many updates as the time passed, also after deciding not to release the client I was just messing around and breaking/testing stuff)*

**A lot of stuff was broken/deleted after discontinuing the client**

Since I left the community I decided to Open Source it, the client is not perfect, I've used
some outside sources to create it **(it was never meant to be behind a paywall, I've always treated the client as a purpose to learn)**, if I were to re-do
the entire thing, I would improve the overall code-base a lot.

Even tho the client was never released, it brought some attention, mainly from being the only one
to have certain features enhancing the gameplay on servers using Vulcan *(Strafe Speed without C07, Instant Freecam Fly)*,

The **Freecam** fly is still somewhat working, but it needs tweaking due to new Prediction checks added in
the recent Vulcan Update. If You are reading it, feel free to use any Bypass that is somewhat still viable.
